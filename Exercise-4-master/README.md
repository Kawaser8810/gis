# Exercise-4

This week we will practice how to do data classification and aggregation in Geopandas. We continue from the last week's exerise with rather similar idea. In this exercise we use data from the Helsinki Region Travel Time Matrix as input.
The overall aim this week is to define dominance areas [0] for 8 shopping centers in Helsinki with different travel modes (Public tranport, private car). The last step is to find out how many people live within the dominance areas of those big shopping centers in Helsinki Region.

[0]: Here, we define the dominance area of a service as the geographical area from where the given service (shopping center) is the closest one to reach in terms of travel time.

- **Exercise 4 is due by the end of day on Wed 28.11.**
- **Scores on this exercise are out of 20 points.**
